# SimpleTemplates
A template system for PowerShell, based on here-strings and stuff

Rather than creating a syntax specifically for templates in Powershell, SimpleTemplates utilizes scriptblocks along with here-strings to render your HTML.
This technique allows the flexibility to generate markup in your favourite editor, and then embedding PowerShell expressions throughout your html files.
